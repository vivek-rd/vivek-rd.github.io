Hello! My name is Vivek. I am currently studying Masters in Data Science at Khoury College of Computer Science, Northeastern University, Boston. 

# H1 Background & Bio

I have 4.5 years of experience working in Data Science industry. Most recently, I worked as a Senior Data Analyst at [Demandbase](https://www.demandbase.com), a B2B AdTech SaaS company based out of San Francisco. 

A friend of mine writes short stories. One sunny day, I asked if he wanted a website to showcase his works and he agreed. I decided to use GitHub Pages to host his site. That way he wouldn't have to buy a domain and a server.

While doing some research up on GitHub Pages, I accidentally chanced upon this _simple, blog-aware, static site generator_ called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which works really well with GitHub Pages. I figured it would do just fine for my friend and I set about searching for a pretty theme. I wanted a theme with a _book-ish_ vibe. Unfortunately, most of the themes were too modern. Eventually, I caved and begun working on my own theme. With the help of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), the Jekyll Butler, I was able to build **Tale**.
