Last semester(Spring 2024), I enrolled in [DS5230](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/vip/teach/DMcourse/html/schedulen_mod.html) course - Unsupervised Machine Learning course at Northeastern University. Here is a short review of the course.

This is a core course of MSDS program at Northeastern and it was taught by Prof. Virgil Pavlu. The course deals with clustering, pre-processing for down-stream tasks. We have discussed topics such as EM algorithm, PCA, Kernel-PCA, LDA (Topic Modelling)

Prof emphasized on intuition rather than going thoroughly in math equations.

At the end of the course, Prof briefly went over Recommender Systems, Graphs and Knowledge Bases, Anamoly Detection.

There were 9 assignments in total covering all the topics that were discussed in the class and each assignment took around 8-10 hours of solid work. Prof Pavlu also discussed about the road blocks that students would face while solving the assignments and this made our life easy.
